# CONTRIBUTING

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## Issues
As usual, [check if issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments) in GitHub issue tracker.

## Commit messages
Please conform to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.


## Used tools

### Linters

#### MegaLinter
[MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/) is used in [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), which checks all the source code.

Can be run locally, but it is pain. See [MegaLinter Runner](https://megalinter.io/latest/mega-linter-runner/).


#### commitlint (soon depreciated)
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) checks if the commit message conforms to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.


#### bugbundle/commits (coming soon)
[bugbundle/commits](https://github.com/bugbundle/commits) checks if the commit message conforms to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

To run locally, check [Tooling for Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits).
