# Get started

This guide will provide instructions step by step on how to get started with firmware-action, and it will demonstrate the use on [coreboot](https://coreboot.org/) example.

In this guide we will:
- start a new repository
    - in this guide it will be hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- we will build a simple coreboot for [QEMU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU)
- we will be able to build coreboot in GitHub action and locally

The code from this example is available in [firmware-action-example](https://github.com/9elements/firmware-action-example).


## Prerequisites

- installed [Docker](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker)
