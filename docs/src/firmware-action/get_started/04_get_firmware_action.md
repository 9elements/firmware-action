# Get firmware-action

Either [clone the repository and build the executable yourself](../usage_local.md), or just download pre-compiled executable from [releases](https://github.com/9elements/firmware-action/releases).

For Arch Linux there is also a [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firmware-action) available.
