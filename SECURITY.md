# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support only the single latest version.

Supporting multiple versions would create too much workload. Thank you for understanding.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please email [cybersecurity@9elements.com](mailto:cybersecurity@9elements.com?subject=firmware%2Daction%3A%20vulnerability%20report).


## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
